## Introduction
<p align = "justify">
This project aims to detect the occupancy a confined/ closed area to ensure that the maximum occupany of the space is not exceeded to ensure social distancing measures. There are parallel sensing systems to assess the occupancy. First, a Photosensitive Light sensor module was used to assess movement near the door (Occupancy instance). Further, a break beam sensor has been added to the sensing system to aid detection of people entering and exiting the room. Once the maximum occupancy is reached a Red LED is triggered. </p>

## Motivation
<p align = "justify">
With social distancing becoming a highly important due to the COVID pandemic, it has become important to ensure that the maximum occupancy in any room or confined space is not exceeded. CDC regulations require that occupancy limit of public spaces is not exceeded. It is thus important to a person attempting to enter the room incase the maximum occupancy is reached.</p>

## Goals
<p align = "justify">
The goal is to record the number of occupants in a room and assess if it has reached the maximum allowed occupancy according to guidlines and alert with an LED light once the capacity is reached. The following points give a breakdown of the goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> Sense entry and exit of people using the digital switch input and output of the photosensitive light sensor module and the signals from the break beam sensor. </li>
<li> Monitor the signals from the sensors and publish them ton the Openchirp platform. </li>
 <li> Calculate the nuber of occupants in the room from the signals acquired from the sensors</li>
 <li> Compare the number against the set limit for the number of occupants in the room and set off a Red LED once the limit is reached. </li> </ul>

## Experiments and Results
<p align = "justify">
I had done multiple levels of testing and experimentation. First I tested the circuits and the code by using in animate objects as objects of interest that enter and leave a region. Assessed the efficiency in of the code and set the thresholds.</p>

<p align = "justify">
I had further used the common space in my apartment which had a single point of entrance and exit as my test field. I had placed the light sensor on the door frame, and taped the break beam sensor across the floor. The maximum occupancy was set to 3 people since the area was small.</p>

<p align = "justify">
With each entry the count of the number of people was set to increase by one and with each exit the number would decrease until the room is empty.</p>

<p align = "justify">
I had initially tested out the set up by my self. Further, this system was tested for a couple of hours. It counted the number of people in the room based on the data and triggered the LED once the set limit was reached.</p>
